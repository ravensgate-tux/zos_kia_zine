## 🇬🇧 The Background of Spare's occult beliefs

Spare's magical system is based on techniques and rituals that are peculiar to
initiates of the Left Hand Path, an approach following magical and religious
traditions where it is common to use sexual energies to gain spiritual objectives.
Originally, the term was used to categorise certain schools and rituals of Hinduism
and Buddhism, such as the Hindu yogic techniques of the C'han school of Chinese
Buddhism and the rituals of Tantric Buddhism. Later, the term was subsumed into
the figures of the Western esoteric tradition in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth-century Magical Revival; including occultists like Spare and Aleister
Crowley (1875–1947), also a Brit, who became famous through the several pop
stars influenced by him, namely The Beatles and David Bowie.
In fact, Crowley,rather than Spare, is arguably the best known figure practising the rituals 
of the Left Hand Path. Moreover, it is Crowley who had the greater impact on the modern
revival of magic and witchcraft in the Western World.
However, Crowley was influenced by Spare's writings and admired his work so
much that he adopted Spare's sigils in his system of ceremonial magic. This is
often overlooked when Crowley's importance in the domain of sexual magic is
underlined. In the literature on sexuality in the occult arts, Crowley is seen as the
first person who linked Tantrism with the Western esoteric tradition and conjoined
Western and Eastern magical techniques in his rituals.iii But in fact, Spare was
doing this at the same time as Crowley.
Kenneth Grant, who knew both occultists, compared the sorcery and the magic
that Spare and Crowley practised. Even though Crowley called Spare his ‘black
brother’, their methods differed from each other in many ways. Kenneth claims
that Spare was more inspired by the history of sorcery, whereas Crowley was
inspired by the history of magic. The key problem with this claim is that Spare also
used the methods of magical rituals, and sigils are a good example of that. The next
comparison is, in any case, key if we want to better understand the differences
between the two occultists.

>For Spare, as for Aleister Crowley, sex is the fulcrum of sorcery and
magic, and the key to both their systems. But whereas for Spare sorcery is
a means of realizing pleasure, of transforming age into youth, ugliness
into beauty, nature into art; for Crowley, magic is a means of acquiring
and radiating power, transforming weakness into strength, ignorance into
knowledge.iv

The most essential influence for Spare's work comes from a colonial woman
named Paterson, whom Spare met for the first time when still a child. Paterson was
a fortune-teller who claimed she was a descendant from a line of Salem witches.
Grant states that Paterson can be seen as a role model for Spare. She was a person
who “could change at will into a creature of extraordinary seductiveness.”v This
claim is significant when we explore the sigils, whose main aim was to be charged
with the will of the creator and to make the creator's deepest desires true.
