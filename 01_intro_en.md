## 🇬🇧 Introduction

Recently, there has been renewed interest in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth-century occultist movement in Britain. In the history of occultism this
period is called the Magical Revival, when newly formed societies such as the
Brotherhood of the Silver Star, the Golden Dawn and the Theosophical Society
arose focusing on exploring the magic and occult ideas of the Western tradition, as
well as renewing and developing them. During this period several artists and
writers became inspired by occultism. One such person was Austin Osman Spare
who, in addition to his artistic reputation, created a system of magic upon which
his creative work is based.
In order to accurately understand Spare's artistic reputation, we have to be
acquainted with the form of magic which he practised and the occult sources of his
artistic inspiration and creativity.
This paper on the magical system of Spare's sigils highlights just one example
of the esoteric writing systems which form the basis of my doctoral thesis. In order
to establish the context for this paper more clearly, I will briefly explain the
background of my research. The main aim of my thesis is to define the term
‘asemic’, referring to a private style of writing which cannot be expressed
verbally,ii within the context of literary theory by providing effective examples
within the tradition. Spare's sigils are a private form of writing which fits into this
concept.
The second part of this paper focuses on the background of Spare's occult
beliefs, and touches on his relationship with Aleister Crowley. The third part of the
paper deals with Spare's Zos Kia Cultus on whose key symbols the magical system
of his sigils is based. The fourth part of the paper examines how Spare used sigils
in occult rituals. Finally, I will briefly discuss Roy Harris' theory of semiology
which argues the importance of examining writing as an individual form of
expression.
