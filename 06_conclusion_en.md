## 🇬🇧 Conclusion

Spare's sigils are their own medium of expression. They are an esoteric form of
writing containing a special communicative function. After exploring the sigils
from the point of view of Spare's cult, it would be logical to continue analysing
them on their aesthetic and material level. Spare's one urge was to create a private
form of art, but is it also possible to find the meanings behind such private forms of
writing, and in doing so, develop methods of analysing these intimately constructed
characters on their aesthetic level?
Since Spare's death, his system of sigils has been developed by others. One
such development is the hypersigil, popularised by the comic book writer, Grant
Morrison. Morrison claimed in the Book of Lies (2014) that his series The Invisibles
was a hypersigilxxviii, indicating that the tradition of sigils continues its vibrant
life as a part of popular culture and, therefore, one worthy of further investigation.
