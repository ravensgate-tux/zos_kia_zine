## 🇬🇧 An esoteric form of writing

Having established the basics of the magical system of sigils, it is now
important to amplify the etymology of the term. The term sigil derives from the
Latin sigillum and sigilla “statuettes, little images and seal,” and it is a diminutive
of the Latin signum ‘sign’.xxi The last meaning is especially pertinent from the
perspective of asemic writing. It can thus be suggested that each sigil has a specific
meaning, but in Spare's system of magic, the interpreter cannot read the meanings
of the sigils just by looking at them. Spare's method of writing through sigils is,
therefore, esoteric, “not openly admitted; private,”xxii as is demonstrated in Image 1
on the first page of paper.
M onograms are another interesting concept concerning sigils. The term is part
of Benoît Grévin's and Julien Véronèse's classification where they have divided
medieval signs into six families. Their definition of the term is ”signs composed of
identifiable elements such as letters.”xxiii Sigils have also been called “monograms
of thought, for the government of energy” which was suggesting that they were a
form of meditation.xxiv Therefore, it seems that sigils are multidisciplinary
characters, which is possible to interpreter in diverse ways.
Conversely, in examining Spare's sigils through Roy Harris' theory of
semiology, a completely different context for Spare's cult is revealed. The main
claim of Harris’ book is that, in the Western World, writing has long been seen as
merely a transcription of oral language, not as its own medium of expression.
Harris holds the opposite to be true. Spare is a notable example of an artist who
created a form of writing which can be seen as its own form of expression. Harris
gives several examples of this kind of poet and artist:

>communication does not depend either on the existence of an oral
language which it transcribes, or on the existence of orthographic
conventions which govern it, only the persistence of earlier and more rigid
ways of thinking can prevent recognition of the conclusion that writing
can create its own forms of expression. It took the genius of Mallarme,
Apollinaire and Joyce, as it had taken the genius of Picasso and Braque, to
turn theoretical possibilities into semiological realities.xx

Harris explains that, if it seems unusual at all to create a private form of writing
which is capable of possessing an important function, it is due to our Western cultural
context. He argues that we think language is medium-transferable, “words, it
is supposed, can be spoken ‘transferred' into a different form where they are visible
but no longer audible, and then 'transferred' back again into speech,”xxvi but in fact,
it is mostly just the Latin script and its different forms, which work in such a way.
We cannot read aloud Spare's sigils, but we know that they contain a special
meaning which their creator knew when he used them. We also now know the magical
system of sigils, and it is possible for us to create them ourselves if we want.
Spare's sigils had a special function; their creator used them to communicate with
his unconscious self, and that was something he could not do with formal writing
systems. As Spare wrote, “There is nothing simpler than speaking to your inmost
self, and nothing more difficult.”xxvii
