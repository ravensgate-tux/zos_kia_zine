##  🇬🇧 The Essential Symbols of Zos Kia Cultus

Two of the main symbols of Spare’s cult were the Zos and the Kia, whose
meanings were analysed superbly by Grant. It is important to note that while their
meaning has a theoretical level, they are still part of a cult whose rituals are,
typically for sexual magic, concrete. As Grant explains,

> The cult of the Zos and the Kia involves the polarized interplay of sexual
energy– positive and negative currents–symbolized anthropomorph by the hand and the eye.
> These organs are the means whereby the sorcerer
invokes primal energies latent in the subconsciousness.

It can be suggested that Spare rejected formal writing systems because he
wanted to create a private, and personal, form of writing to invoke primal energies
latent in the subconsciousness. The analysis of the main symbols of this cult
indicates that this objective is not just part of the system of his sigils but a
fundamental of his entire cult.
Spare gave to these two main symbols several names which added to their
meaning. The symbol of Zos is the hand which he also named All Sensing Touch.
By contrast, the symbol of Kia is the eye also named All Seeing Vision. He
explains that these elements are the magical instruments needed to connect to one’s
primal desire or innate obsession. In his system, Zos is fused together with its
opposing energy, Kia, which renders them deities of the flesh.vii The sigils are one
way to actualize this aim.
In order to completely understand these key symbols of the cult, the next
definition is important.

> 'Zos' he defined as “The body considered as a whole”, by which he
included body, mind, and soul; it was the alembic of his sorcery.
His other key symbol, the Kia, represents the Atmospheric 'I', THE
Cosmic Self, which uses Zos as its field of activity.

Such are the concrete, abstract and universal meanings of the main symbols of
Spare's Zos Kia Cultus. In summary, these symbols can be seen as the feminine and
masculine part of sexual energy where the Zos represents a masculine force and the
Kia a feminine force.
